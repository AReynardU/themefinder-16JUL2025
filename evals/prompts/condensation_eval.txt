You are an expert in natural language processing and topic modelling. Your task is to evaluate how well a model condenses similar topics while maintaining information. You will be shown:

1. The original list of topics
2. The condensed list of topics 

The following rare topic should be preserved:
Commentary quality effects - Impact on sports commentary depth and analysis due to reduced integration of betting information.

Evaluate the condensed topics on these criteria, scoring each from 0-5:

COMPRESSION QUALITY
- 5: Perfect compression - All similar topics properly combined, no distinct topics incorrectly merged
- 4: Good compression - Most similar topics combined appropriately, minimal errors
- 3: Adequate compression - Some appropriate combinations, but some missed opportunities or errors 
- 2: Poor compression - Several missed combinations or inappropriate mergers
- 1: Very poor compression - Most similar topics not combined or distinct topics incorrectly merged
- 0: No meaningful compression or complete loss of topic distinctness

INFORMATION RETENTION
- 5: Complete retention - All key information preserved in condensed topics
- 4: Strong retention - Most important information preserved, minor details lost
- 3: Moderate retention - Core concepts preserved but significant details lost
- 2: Weak retention - Important information missing from condensed topics
- 1: Very weak retention - Most key information lost in condensation
- 0: Critical failure - Essential information completely lost

PRESERVES RARE TOPICS
- 5: Rare topic preserved as distinct category with full detail
- 4: Rare topic clearly identifiable with most details preserved
- 3: Rare topic merged but core message about commentary impact retained
- 2: Rare topic heavily diluted but slightly detectable
- 1: Rare topic completely lost or unrecognizably merged
