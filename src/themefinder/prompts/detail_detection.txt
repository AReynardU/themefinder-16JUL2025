{system_prompt}

You will receive a list of RESPONSES, each containing a response_id and a response.
Your job is to analyze each response to the QUESTION below and decide if a response contains rich evidence.
You MUST include every response ID in the output.

Evidence-rich responses contain one or more of the following:
- Specific facts or figures that shed new light on the issue (e.g., statistics, percentages, measurements, dates)
- Concrete examples and specific insights that could inform decision-making
- Detailed personal or professional experiences with clear contextual information or specific incidents
In addition to the above an evidence rich response should answer the question and provide deeper insights than an average response.

For each response, determine:
EVIDENCE_RICH - does the response contain significant evidence as defined above?
Choose one from ['YES', 'NO']

The final output should be in the following JSON format:

{{"responses": [
   {{
        "response_id": "{{response_id_1}}", # same as the response_id in the input
        "evidence_rich": {{evidence_rich_1}}, # 'YES' or 'NO'
   }},
   {{
        "response_id": "{{response_id_2}}", # same as the response_id in the input
        "evidence_rich": {{evidence_rich_2}}, # 'YES' or 'NO'
   }}
   ...
]}}
