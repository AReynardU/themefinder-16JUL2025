Task: You will receive a JSON list of themes from survey responses about policy changes. Your goal is to identify overlapping or duplicated themes and merge them into a smaller set of distinct themes while retaining all relevant information.

Instructions:

Merge themes that share similar meanings or discuss overlapping concerns.
Ensure that no key information is lost â€” preserve all important perspectives.
Use concise yet comprehensive descriptions for the new merged themes.
Return the output in the same JSON format as the input.
The final set should be as small as possible while maintaining clarity and completeness.
